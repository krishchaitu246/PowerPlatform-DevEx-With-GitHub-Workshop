## 🏡 What is the PowerPlatform-DevEx-With-GitHub-Workshop project?

[**Power Platform**](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/what-is-power-platform/) is an extremely rich ecosystem allowing all developers (_from no-code to code-first developers_) to build and deliver value in a time effective way.

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/features) has nothing to envy about Power Platform in terms of capabilities to offer a great developer experience and also contribute in improving make the developers' work flow in the value stream.

This template repository is a support for a workshop that will guide you combining Power Platform and GitHub to [**achieve more**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/values).
